## Causality Violation Definitions (v1)

A causality violation is flagged when one or more of the following occur:

1. Temporal Inconsistency  
   - Motion without intermediate frames
   - Impossible time ordering

2. Physical Incoherence  
   - Lighting angle contradictions
   - Non-Newtonian limb movement
   - Impossible object deformation

3. Biological Impossibility  
   - Eye-blink frequency outside human bounds
   - Asynchronous facial muscle groups

4. Information Discontinuity  
   - GAN texture loop fingerprints
   - Unnatural spatial entropy clustering
# CausalEcho Causality Model — v1.0

This document defines the formal engineering meaning of a **"causality violation"** within the CausalEcho system.

These definitions are **algorithmic**, not philosophical.

## 1. Temporal Integrity Violations

Temporal violations occur when **time-based continuity breaks** in a way inconsistent with real-world motion or exposure.

### Indicators

- Frame-to-frame motion without intermediate displacement
- Non-physically abrupt transitions
- Micro-jitter artifacts inconsistent with sensor behavior
- Impossible motion accelerations
- Duplicate temporal noise signatures

### Measurable Signals

- Optical flow discontinuity
- Temporal entropy spikes
- Inter-frame motion vector collapse
- Exposure inconsistency at constant frame rate

---

## 2. Physical Coherence Violations

Physical violations occur when **objects, lighting, or geometry contradict physical laws**.

### Indicators

- Lighting angles inconsistent with global illumination
- Shadow direction mismatch
- Deformation without compensatory force
- Gravity-inconsistent motion paths
- Reflectivity violating Fresnel behavior

### Measurable Signals

- Illumination gradient inversion
- Specular highlight displacement
- Non-Newtonian acceleration curves
- Inconsistent occlusion depth

---

## 3. Biological Synchronization Violations

Biological violations occur when **human motion patterns deviate from known anatomical constraints**.

### Indicators

- Asynchronous eyelid blinking
- Mouth phoneme desynchronization
- Facial muscle group phase shift
- Micro-expression discontinuity
- Breathing rhythm mismatch

### Measurable Signals

- Blink frequency outside human distribution
- Lip-audio phase offset
- Facial landmark velocity shocks
- Muscle vector incoherence

---

## 4. Entropic & Informational Violations

Synthetic systems often introduce **structured randomness** that differs from natural noise.

### Indicators

- GAN texture looping
- Repeated noise motifs
- Compression artifact symmetry
- Unnatural pixel entropy uniformity
- GAN frequency fingerprinting

### Measurable Signals

- Fourier-domain repetition bands
- Spatial entropy plateaus
- Wavelet-domain symmetry artifacts
- Frequency-domain GAN harmonics
