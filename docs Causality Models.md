   - Motion without intermediate frames
   - Impossible time ordering

2. Physical Incoherence  
   - Lighting angle contradictions
   - Non-Newtonian limb movement
   - Impossible object deformation

3. Biological Impossibility  
   - Eye-blink frequency outside human bounds
   - Asynchronous facial muscle groups

4. Information Discontinuity
