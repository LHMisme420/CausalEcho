# CausalEcho Manifest

CausalEcho is an experimental reality-verification engine.
It does not claim perfect detection.
It evaluates **causality consistency, physical coherence, and temporal integrity** as heuristic signals of authenticity.

CausalEcho:
- ❌ Does NOT guarantee absolute proof
- ✅ DOES provide probabilistic causality scoring
- ✅ IS designed for forensic, ethical, and experimental use
