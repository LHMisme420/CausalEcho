## 6. Verdict Threshold System

| Causality Score | Verdict |
|-----------------|----------|
| 0.85 – 1.00 | Highly Authentic |
| 0.70 – 0.85 | Likely Authentic |
| 0.50 – 0.70 | Indeterminate |
| 0.30 – 0.50 | Likely Synthetic |
| 0.00 – 0.30 | Highly Synthetic |

## 7. Interpretation Policy

CausalEcho does not issue binary truth claims.

It issues:

- **Likelihood bands**
- **Metric breakdowns**
- **Violation vectors**

The system is designed to assist human analysts — not replace them.

---

## 8. Model Evolution Policy

This causality model is versioned and **designed to evolve under empirical validation**.

Future expansions may include:

- Audio causality layers
- Sensor physics modeling
- Multi-spectral verification
- Physical simulation reconciliation

## Final Definition

> A causality violation is a **measurable deviation from the physical, temporal, biological, or entropic constraints observed in real-world systems.**

This is what CausalEcho detects.

Not deception.
Not intent.

**Constraint failure.**
